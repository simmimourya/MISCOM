MISCOM: A SCHEDULING ALGORITHM TO REDUCE COMMUNICATION OVEHEAD IN PARALLEL SYSTEMS ( MATLAB SIMULATION)

Parallel computer systems are often used when dealing with problems requiring high
amounts of computation. While it is apparent that having multiple processors can
reduce the computation time, the amount of reduction is not directly proportional to
the increased number of processors. Communication overhead diminishes these
gains, and it is caused by the inherent message exchanges between individual
processors. Techniques for better scheduling already existed. The techniques that are
studied in this project used the concept of collision graph that is explained further.
Scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First come first serve), ISCOM, or Independent Set COMMUNICATION, MISCOM, or Maximal Independent Set COMMUNICATION
Were studied and MISCOM having best efficiency was studied extensively and a stimulation is developed in MATLAB.
